# React - Hangman

This hangman program will take a letter from you and you need to guess a word to win. <br />Answers are animals but you can modify answers in the list.<br />

## Installation

You can simply download the files on your computer. <br />
In terminal, install by typing `npm install`.  <br />
And install confetti by typing `npm install --save react-confetti`.  <br />
And type `npm start` to start the program.

## Change Answers

You can insert/delete answers in the file. On #21 in 'src/containers/Game.js', you can find an array of answers. You add more or remove the answers you don't want. I put only animal answers but feel free to put any words you'd like.
